# dotfiles

These are my personal configuration files. They're managed using [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick).

The most interesting things here are probably [my hammerspoon configuration](https://github.com/dbmrq/dotfiles/tree/master/home/.hammerspoon) and [my `.vimrc`](https://github.com/dbmrq/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.vimrc), which is split into the [`settings.vim`](https://github.com/dbmrq/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.vim/settings.vim), [`mappings.vim`](https://github.com/dbmrq/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.vim/mappings.vim), [`functions.vim`](https://github.com/dbmrq/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.vim/functions.vim) and [`plugins.vim`](https://github.com/dbmrq/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.vim/plugins.vim) files. There's also some cool stuff at [my `ftplugin` files](https://github.com/dbmrq/dotfiles/tree/master/home/.vim/ftplugin).
